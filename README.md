- V1.5 Added B button to reset bomb, added "defusing" screen when defusing, and added 3 beeps after defusal.

A fake C4 project for the M5StickCPlus2 made in Arduino.
Press the M5 button to plant the bomb, at end press the M5 button again to restart the bomb.
After planting you can hold the M5 button for 5 seconds to defuse the bomb, after defusal it will reset the bomb.
Contact me on Discord for any questions and requests, maybe add to STICK1. @goodbucks
